00:24:43,957 --> 00:24:46,957
Hey.

328
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:48,059
Can I help you?

329
00:24:48,061 --> 00:24:49,628
Looking to sign up.

330
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,995
- Where you from?
- L.A.

331
00:24:51,997 --> 00:24:53,297
Hollywood!

332
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:55,199
Which gym? I know all those guys.

333
00:24:55,201 --> 00:24:58,836
Don't have one. I'm more self-taught.

334
00:24:58,838 --> 00:25:00,839
Self-taught?

335
00:25:00,841 --> 00:25:02,674
You know Balboa?

336
00:25:02,676 --> 00:25:05,243
Yes, we grew up together.

337
00:25:05,245 --> 00:25:07,210
Most members just work themselves out.

338
00:25:07,212 --> 00:25:09,013
For an extra $20 a month,

339
00:25:09,015 --> 00:25:12,283
I can give you drills,
check in on you when I can.

340
00:25:12,285 --> 00:25:13,819
Yeah, that works.

00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,407
Unc!

368
00:27:16,409 --> 00:27:18,543
How you doing?

369
00:27:18,545 --> 00:27:20,145
Did you call me "Unc"?

370
00:27:20,147 --> 00:27:22,647
Yeah, it was either that or O.G.

371
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:24,416
What's an "O.G."?

372
00:27:24,418 --> 00:27:26,818
Old-ass gangster.

373
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,285
"Unc" is good.

374
00:27:28,287 --> 00:27:29,820
I can do that.

375
00:27:29,822 --> 00:27:31,922
It's all good.

376
00:27:31,924 --> 00:27:33,890
So why'd you come by? You hungry?

377
00:27:33,892 --> 00:27:35,793
No, I just wrapped up at the gym.

378
00:27:35,795 --> 00:27:37,160
Figured I'd stop by.

379
00:27:37,162 --> 00:27:39,898
Okay.

380
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,265
Maybe ask you a question.

381
00:27:41,267 --> 00:27:45,503
Sure. I can do all this.

382
00:27:45,505 --> 00:27:46,736
Uh...

383
00:27:46,738 --> 00:27:49,239
What are some drills I can
do to get my hand speed up?

384
00:27:49,241 --> 00:27:51,175
Some guys up there, I
bet they can help you.

385
00:27:51,177 --> 00:27:52,610
There's a guy there named Pete.

386
00:27:52,612 --> 00:27:54,312
He's a pretty good trainer.

387
00:27:54,314 --> 00:27:57,247
Yeah, but he's with his
fighter most of the time.

388
00:27:57,249 --> 00:28:00,318
I mostly just train myself.

389
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,888
They know you're a Creed?

390
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,956
I don't go by that.

391
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:07,190
I'm trying to make it on my own.

392
00:28:07,192 --> 00:28:08,391
Name's Johnson.

393
00:28:08,393 --> 00:28:10,794
- Who's Johnson?
- Mom's name.

394
00:28:10,796 --> 00:28:14,197
Plus, just makes life easier.

395
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:16,201
Uh-huh.

396
00:28:19,405 --> 00:28:21,038
Plus, you know, if you train me

397
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,339
ain't nobody around here knows me.

398
00:28:22,341 --> 00:28:25,310
We could fly under the radar.

399
00:28:25,312 --> 00:28:27,812
- They'd never know.
- Yeah.

400
00:28:27,814 --> 00:28:29,246
I told you before,

401
00:28:29,248 --> 00:28:32,450
I just don't wanna do it, kid.

402
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:36,220
That's cool, but maybe you could just

403
00:28:36,222 --> 00:28:38,822
give me some drills.

404
00:28:38,824 --> 00:28:42,526
- Drills?
- Yeah, things I could do on my own.

405
00:28:42,528 --> 00:28:46,264
You don't stop, do you?
You're like a woodpecker.

406
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,601
My God.

407
00:28:54,673 --> 00:28:57,574
All right. I got a few.

408
00:28:57,576 --> 00:28:59,576
But that's it. Okay?

409
00:28:59,578 --> 00:29:00,645
Of course.

410
00:29:00,647 --> 00:29:04,716
Five rounds of jumping rope.

411
00:29:04,718 --> 00:29:09,219
Three rounds on each of the bags...

412
00:29:09,221 --> 00:29:10,688
When you get to the heavy bag,

413
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,189
just don't keep throwing your hands

414
00:29:12,191 --> 00:29:13,824
because you can hurt them.

415
00:29:13,826 --> 00:29:16,660
It's also about using your legs, all right?

416
00:29:16,662 --> 00:29:21,666
And then five rounds of...

417

- There's a "W." Boxing.
- Boxing, yeah.

420
00:29:26,605 --> 00:29:29,274
And that's it.

421
00:29:29,276 --> 00:29:31,207
- All right?
- Yeah.

422
00:29:31,209 --> 00:29:32,877
Okay, here you go.

423
00:29:32,879 --> 00:29:34,043
Oh, that is perfect.

424
00:29:34,045 --> 00:29:36,880
Good luck with that.

00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,295
All right, man.

428
00:29:51,297 --> 00:29:53,230
Wait, don't you want this?

429
00:29:53,232 --> 00:29:54,430
I got it right here.

430
00:29:54,432 --> 00:29:56,266
What if you lose that thing or it breaks?

431
00:29:56,268 --> 00:29:59,337
It's already up in the cloud.

432
00:30:02,307 --> 00:30:05,744
What cloud? What cloud?

433
00:30:07,212 --> 00:30:08,946
Hey, Ma, it's me.

434
00:30:08,948 --> 00:30:11,881
I was just calling to let
you know I'm doing good

435
00:30:11,883 --> 00:30:13,784
and I got an apartment.

<i>I wanna hear from you,</i>

439
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:23,762
so call me back when you
get a chance. All right.

No, I just heard you down here working.

Figured you'd wanna take a break.

Maybe get some food?

Right.

you know where you wanna go?

I was hoping you could tell me.

00:32:44,103 --> 00:32:45,703
Like, a dude?

492
00:32:45,705 --> 00:32:47,470
No.

493
00:32:47,472 --> 00:32:49,540
I got too much going on right now.

494
00:32:49,542 --> 00:32:50,774
Shows and stuff?

495
00:32:50,776 --> 00:32:52,043
Yeah.

496
00:32:52,045 --> 00:32:54,478
I'm opening at Electric Factory next month.

497
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,646
What's that?

498
00:32:55,648 --> 00:32:56,980
It's a big venue out here.

499
00:32:56,982 --> 00:32:58,649
A lot of people got their start.

500
00:32:58,651 --> 00:33:01,386
Jill, Legend, the Roots.

501
00:33:01,388 --> 00:33:03,756
That's wassup.

502
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,457
Can I ask you something personal?

503
00:33:07,459 --> 00:33:09,594
Mmm-hmm.

504
00:33:12,998 --> 00:33:16,467
I got progressive hearing loss.

505
00:33:16,469 --> 00:33:18,303
Just started wearing these this past year.

506
00:33:18,305 --> 00:33:21,138
But I only need them in places
with a lot of background noise.

507
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,239
For now.

508
00:33:23,241 --> 00:33:26,009
So it's progressive, so eventually...

509
00:33:26,011 --> 00:33:28,845
Yeah.

510
00:33:28,847 --> 00:33:30,581
Yeah.

511
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:32,114
I'm just getting ready for it.

512
00:33:32,116 --> 00:33:33,350
Like I'm getting used to these,

513
00:33:33,352 --> 00:33:36,453
I'm learning sign language and stuff.

514
00:33:36,455 --> 00:33:40,858
But I really can only remember bad words.

515
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,063
Ones that aren't that useful like...

516
00:33:45,664 --> 00:33:47,965
(CHUCKLES) The fuck's that?

517
00:33:47,967 --> 00:33:52,203
You can't tell? This is the
bull, the horns, this is...

518
00:33:52,205 --> 00:33:54,538
Yeah, this is bullshit.

519
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,706
That's your favorite?

520
00:33:55,708 --> 00:33:57,640
(CHUCKLES) Uh-huh.

521
00:33:57,642 --> 00:34:00,177
You don't really seem like a boxer to me.

522
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:02,513
I mean, you're in shape and all but...

523
00:34:02,515 --> 00:34:04,581
I don't know. Aren't most boxers like...

524
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:06,484
- Like what?
- Like street.

525
00:34:06,486 --> 00:34:08,686
I'm not saying you're a square or anything,

526
00:34:08,688 --> 00:34:11,387
but I'm just curious,
what made you wanna fight?

527
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:12,689
My pop was a fighter.

528
00:34:12,691 --> 00:34:14,892
Oh, right. That makes sense.

529
00:34:14,894 --> 00:34:16,961
Did he fight pro?

530
00:34:16,963 --> 00:34:19,128
Something like that.

531
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:21,064
Does he train you?

532
00:34:21,066 --> 00:34:23,969
My pop died before I was born.

533
00:34:26,872 --> 00:34:29,673
I'm sorry to hear that.

534
00:34:29,675 --> 00:34:33,278
So what made you wanna sing?

535
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:40,885
Uh...

536
00:34:40,887 --> 00:34:43,923
It makes me feel alive.

537
00:34:46,691 --> 00:34:48,526
Where's your next show?

538
00:34:48,528 --> 00:34:51,762
That place that you saw
me at, Johnny Brenda's.

539
00:34:51,764 --> 00:34:56,434
I got a residency there
so we're back on Friday.

540
00:34:58,838 --> 00:35:01,370
Can I roll with you?

541
00:35:01,372 --> 00:35:05,077
I wanna show up, you know. Show some love.

542
00:35:07,612 --> 00:35:09,914
Let me think on it.

543
00:35:31,704 --> 00:35:33,736
Okay.

544
00:35:33,738 --> 00:35:37,407
Here we go, Paulie.

545
00:35:37,409 --> 00:35:41,579
Happy birthday, my friend.

546
00:35:41,581 --> 00:35:44,481
I didn't forget ya.

547
00:35:44,483 --> 00:35:46,883
Your favorite.

548
00:35:46,885 --> 00:35:49,753
Miss ya, pal.

549
00:35:49,755 --> 00:35:54,323
Yo, Adrian, my darling.

550
00:35:54,325 --> 00:35:57,262
The best of the best.

551
00:35:58,298 --> 00:36:01,831
I'll tell you, Adrian, God.

552
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:06,235
It's getting harder to walk up
this hill. What does that mean?

553
00:36:06,237 --> 00:36:08,405
Anyway, it's a good day today.

554
00:36:08,407 --> 00:36:10,673
It's a good day, got no problems.

555
00:36:10,675 --> 00:36:12,409
Bills are paid.

556
00:36:12,411 --> 00:36:14,577
Only thing is, it's tough to

557
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:16,948
sleep at night sometimes. My back.

558
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:20,517
No matter what you do,
it catches up to you.

559
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:25,590
Anyway, shall we see what's
new in the world today?

560
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,597
Whoa.

561
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,764
Hey, Rocky!

562
00:37:07,766 --> 00:37:08,999
Hey, how you doing?

563
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:10,834
- Good to see you.
- How you doing?

564
00:37:10,836 --> 00:37:12,736
Hey, Rock! Long time no see, brother.

565
00:37:12,738 --> 00:37:14,572
- Still here? Good to see you.
- Yeah.

566
00:37:14,574 --> 00:37:16,073
MAN: Hey, the Italian Stallion's back.

567
00:37:16,075 --> 00:37:17,374
ROCKY: How you doing?

568
00:37:17,376 --> 00:37:18,876
- It's like a party here with everyone.
- Yeah, right.

569
00:37:18,878 --> 00:37:20,077
Welcome back, man. It's been a while.

570
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,144
Yeah, thank you very much.

571
00:37:21,146 --> 00:37:22,213
- How do you feel?
- Good.

572
00:37:22,215 --> 00:37:24,081
- What, are you making a comeback?
- No.

573
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:25,916
- Hey, champ.
- Hey, Pete. What's up?

574
00:37:25,918 --> 00:37:27,017
Didn't know you were coming by.

575
00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:28,251
I didn't either.

576
00:37:28,253 --> 00:37:30,320
I was just in the neighborhood.
You've done nice here.

577
00:37:30,322 --> 00:37:32,588
Place is looking good,
new paint and everything.

578
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,023
- Very good, very nice.
- I do what I can.

579
00:37:34,025 --> 00:37:35,626
- Remember my son, Leo?
- Of course I do.

580
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,093
A lot bigger since you last seen him.

581
00:37:37,095 --> 00:37:38,961
- Yeah, very big.
- Rocky,

582
00:37:38,963 --> 00:37:40,664
he's 17 and 0.

583
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:42,733
Things are really opening up for us.

584
00:37:42,735 --> 00:37:45,302
Leo! Come.

585
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:49,673
Rocky, option's still open
if you wanna get involved.

586
00:37:49,675 --> 00:37:51,809
Little training, little motivation.

587
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,244
Let me think about it.

588
00:37:53,246 --> 00:37:54,311
Sure, sure.

589
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,412
How you doing, kid?

590
00:37:55,414 --> 00:37:56,514
It's an honor to meet you, champ.

591
00:37:56,516 --> 00:37:58,548
ROCKY: Nice to meet you,
too. 17 and 0, very good.

592
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,651
LEO: Yeah, I was supposed to
fight on the Ricky Conlan's card...

593
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,555
- Hey, Unc!
- But it got canceled.

594
00:38:04,724 --> 00:38:05,856
Unc.

595
00:38:05,858 --> 00:38:07,890
- He talking to you?
- Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

596
00:38:07,892 --> 00:38:09,360
- You made it.
- Yeah.

597
00:38:09,362 --> 00:38:12,396
Just walked by. Here I am.

598
00:38:12,398 --> 00:38:13,764
How you know Hollywood?

599
00:38:13,766 --> 00:38:16,733
Uh, we met at the restaurant.

600
00:38:16,735 --> 00:38:19,070
That's it.

601
00:38:21,206 --> 00:38:23,807
Okay, Rock. Okay.

602
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:26,443
You need anything, you let me know.

603
00:38:26,445 --> 00:38:28,311
Okay. Good luck, kid. Seriously.

604
00:38:28,313 --> 00:38:29,579
Thanks.

605
00:38:29,581 --> 00:38:33,916
17 and 0. Kid's got a future. Tough.

606
00:38:33,918 --> 00:38:36,587
Can I talk to you a minute?

607
00:38:42,061 --> 00:38:43,827
I don't really know what I'm doing here

608
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:46,095
because I got other plans for my life

609
00:38:46,097 --> 00:38:47,764
and this wasn't part of it.

610
00:38:47,766 --> 00:38:49,767
Your father was special.

611
00:38:49,769 --> 00:38:52,102
Tell you the truth, I don't
know if you're special.

612
00:38:52,104 --> 00:38:54,572
Only you gonna know that
when the time is right.

613
00:38:54,574 --> 00:38:56,173
It ain't gonna come overnight.

614
00:38:56,175 --> 00:38:57,874
You're gonna take a beating,
you're gonna take this,

615
00:38:57,876 --> 00:38:59,943
you're gonna get knocked
down, you're gonna get up

616
00:38:59,945 --> 00:39:02,046
and you're gonna see if
you got the right thing.

617
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,680
But, you gotta work hard.

618
00:39:04,682 --> 00:39:07,483
I swear to God, if you're not gonna do it,

619
00:39:07,485 --> 00:39:09,952
I'm out.

620
00:39:09,954 --> 00:39:12,689
Rock, every punch I've ever
thrown has been on my own.

621
00:39:12,691 --> 00:39:16,193
Nobody showed me how to do this.

622
00:39:16,195 --> 00:39:18,830
I'm ready.

623
00:39:20,264 --> 00:39:23,034
Come on. Let's do this.

624
00:39:23,036 --> 00:39:25,503
Step into my office.

625
00:39:25,505 --> 00:39:26,570
You serious?

626
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,405
I am serious. This is old school.

627
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,273
You should be able to
grab one of these birds.

628
00:39:30,275 --> 00:39:31,640
30 seconds?

629
00:39:31,642 --> 00:39:35,211
Yeah, in your dreams.

630
00:39:35,213 --> 00:39:37,815
Come on! You call that fast?

631
00:39:44,822 --> 00:39:47,390
No! Again.

632
00:39:47,392 --> 00:39:49,160
ROCKY: I thought you were fast.

633
00:39:49,162 --> 00:39:50,894
Come here! (GRUNTS)

634
00:39:50,896 --> 00:39:52,762
ROCKY: Get them legs moving!

635
00:39:52,764 --> 00:39:55,532
Little harder, little faster!

636
00:39:55,534 --> 00:39:59,503
Keep up the pace! Keep going!

637
00:40:07,847 --> 00:40:12,215
Control your tempo then build slowly.

638
00:40:12,217 --> 00:40:13,383
More.

639
00:40:13,385 --> 00:40:15,751
Build, build, build.

640
00:40:15,753 --> 00:40:17,755
Go!

That bell don't mean school's out, Donnie.

643
00:40:31,704 --> 00:40:33,704
Keep going.

644
00:40:33,706 --> 00:40:36,273
That bell means hell.

645
00:40:36,275 --> 00:40:38,709
Just go get the chicken.
It's not that big a deal.

646
00:40:38,711 --> 00:40:39,876
Come here! God damn it!

ROCKY: Oh, my God!

649
00:40:43,882 --> 00:40:48,385
That's pretty good.
Chickens are slowing down.

650
00:40:48,387 --> 00:40:51,120
All right. Donnie, get into your stance.

651
00:40:51,122 --> 00:40:54,724
Make a small target, turn sideways. Okay.

652
00:40:54,726 --> 00:40:56,892
You see this guy here staring back at you?

653
00:40:56,894 --> 00:40:57,961
Yeah.

That's your toughest opponent.

All right, one to the gut.

Now, every time you punch
this guy, what's he doing?

- He's throwing one back at me.
- That's right.

it or get out of the way. Go.

- Okay.

You're gonna train there,
because I don't want you

to train in the same place

as the guy that you're
gonna be fighting, right?

Do you ride?

No. I had a Harley once but I fell
off, so I decided to use my feet.

844
00:50:31,369 --> 00:50:33,903
Now, this kid, Sporino,
he got something special.

01:04:46,391 --> 01:04:47,789
You told me that your dad was some fighter.

1134
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:49,858
You didn't say he was the most
famous fighter to ever live.

1135
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:51,794
People look at me
differently when they know.

1136
01:04:51,796 --> 01:04:53,128
They look at Apollo differently, too.

1137
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:55,063
Yeah, Donnie, but I'm not people.

1138
01:04:55,065 --> 01:04:56,432
I don't care about that shit.

1139
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:59,267
I do care about you keeping
it 100 with me, though.

1140
01:04:59,269 --> 01:05:01,970
Well, listen. You're right, okay?

1141
01:05:01,972 --> 01:05:05,974
No, seriously, look. You...

1142
01:05:05,976 --> 01:05:09,278
100% honesty from here on out.

1143
01:05:10,648 --> 01:05:14,818
All right. So his... His
wife, that's not your mom?

1144
01:05:15,985 --> 01:05:18,387
Apollo had an affair with my mom.

1145
01:05:18,389 --> 01:05:20,990
All right? She died when I was young.

1146
01:05:20,992 --> 01:05:24,427
I bounced around foster
care for a couple years.

1147
01:05:24,429 --> 01:05:26,928
In and out of juvie.

1148
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:30,499
Then Mary Anne tracked
me down and took me in.

1149
01:05:30,501 --> 01:05:32,835
Anything else?

1150
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:36,438
Ask me.

1151
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,439
How many females have
you been with before me?

1152
01:05:38,441 --> 01:05:41,276
(SIGHS) Anything else?

1153
01:05:41,278 --> 01:05:43,278
Look, Bianca, come on now, you different.

1154
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:44,479
How?

1155
01:05:44,481 --> 01:05:46,914
When I'm around you I feel
like I know you my whole life.

1156
01:05:46,916 --> 01:05:48,284
Mmm-hmm.

1157
01:05:48,286 --> 01:05:49,852
Tell me you don't feel
the same way about me.

1158
01:05:49,854 --> 01:05:52,019
Whatever. That's passion.
That's infatuation. That fades.

1159
01:05:52,021 --> 01:05:53,454
I can't see that happening.

1160
01:05:53,456 --> 01:05:55,423
- Why not?
- You motivate me.

1161
01:05:55,425 --> 01:05:56,825
Okay, so I'm just motivation to you?

1162
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:58,227
Are you gonna find a problem
with everything I say?

1163
01:05:58,229 --> 01:06:01,098
No, I'm gonna find the
real in what you're saying.

1164
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:03,999
Don't worry, it's cool.

1165
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:06,367
Maybe you're just motivation to me, too.

1166
01:06:06,369 --> 01:06:08,671
- Oh, really?
- Mmm-hmm.

1167
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:10,974
I don't mind that.

1168
01:06:12,943 --> 01:06:14,945
What?

1169
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:17,713
You do look like him, though. (CHUCKLES)

1170
01:06:17,715 --> 01:06:19,414
Oh, my God. I hate that!

1171
01:06:19,416 --> 01:06:22,552
- (LAUGHING)
- Just to get on my nerves!

1198
01:07:31,988 --> 01:07:34,289
TOMMY: Check it out.

1199
01:07:34,291 --> 01:07:35,890
(CHUCKLES)

1200
01:07:35,892 --> 01:07:37,258
- Creed's son?
- TOMMY: Yeah.

1201
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:38,894
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

1202
01:07:38,896 --> 01:07:40,262
He's got one fight under his belt.

1203
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:42,331
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know.

1204
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:44,198
But he's got Balboa in his corner.

1205
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:47,302
No one cares about Balboa anymore.

1206
01:07:47,304 --> 01:07:50,171
Kid's here because of a name alone.

1207
01:07:50,173 --> 01:07:51,573
You're gonna do it.

1208
01:07:51,575 --> 01:07:53,309
This guy doesn't even deserve a shot.

1209
01:07:53,311 --> 01:07:56,345
Listen to me. This is not
a negotiation, all right?

1210
01:07:56,347 --> 01:07:58,747
You're the idiot that ran
around Toxteth with a gun.

1211
01:07:58,749 --> 01:08:00,816
Do you remember that?

1212
01:08:00,818 --> 01:08:04,119
And you are the clown who couldn't
control himself at a weigh-in

1213
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:06,188
and lost us millions in
the process. Millions, okay?

1214
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:09,457
So look at it again.

1215
01:08:09,459 --> 01:08:10,925
(SIGHING)

1216
01:08:10,927 --> 01:08:13,162
I don't wanna be remembered like this.

1217
01:08:13,164 --> 01:08:15,296
I don't care how you're remembered.

1218
01:08:15,298 --> 01:08:16,798
I care about your kids having a roof

1220
01:08:18,702 --> 01:08:21,070
Do you understand?

01:08:27,779 --> 01:08:29,477
(PHONE RINGING)

1222
01:08:29,479 --> 01:08:30,545
Hello?

1223
01:08:30,547 --> 01:08:34,451
It's Tommy Holiday. I
look after Ricky Conlan.

1224
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:38,452
- Yeah, how you doing?
- <i>Listen.</i>

1225
01:08:38,454 --> 01:08:41,324
Is it true about the kid?

1226
01:08:42,559 --> 01:08:45,228
About the kid? (CLEARS THROAT)

1227
01:08:47,131 --> 01:08:48,629
Uh...

1228
01:08:48,631 --> 01:08:52,201
Think you and the kid have got
30 minutes for a business meeting?

1229
01:08:54,003 --> 01:08:55,470
All right, I'll tell you what.

1230
01:08:55,472 --> 01:08:57,372
Yeah, if you can get over here, sure.

1231
01:08:57,374 --> 01:09:00,008
We'll talk with you, but it's gotta be fast

1232
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:02,044
because we're training.

1233
01:09:02,046 --> 01:09:03,478
<i>I can be there. Couple of days.</i>

1234
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,347
- Yeah.
- <i>I'll be in touch.</i>

1235
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:07,417
Okay.

1236
01:09:12,021 --> 01:09:14,255
Oh, man.

1237
01:09:14,257 --> 01:09:16,424
TOMMY: Thanks for taking the time.
I'll get right to it.

1238
01:09:16,426 --> 01:09:20,862
My guy needs to fight
in the next six months

1239
01:09:20,864 --> 01:09:23,999
and we've beaten everybody.

1240
01:09:24,001 --> 01:09:26,101
You want me to fight Conlan?

1241
01:09:26,103 --> 01:09:28,336
I think it would be a very wise move.

1242
01:09:28,338 --> 01:09:30,339
TOMMY: You've been down in
Mexico doing pro fights, eh?

1243
01:09:30,341 --> 01:09:32,741
I've got you as 15-0 down there.

1244
01:09:32,743 --> 01:09:35,242
And with the Sporino
fight, that makes you 16-0.

1245
01:09:35,244 --> 01:09:37,612
Now, nobody needs to know these fights

1246
01:09:37,614 --> 01:09:41,450
were in some hole in the wall, do they, eh?

1247
01:09:44,288 --> 01:09:45,754
You think I'm ready?

1248
01:09:45,756 --> 01:09:48,557
Donnie, this man came here because
he knows you're a sure thing.

1249
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:49,657
Right? It's a sure victory.

1250
01:09:49,659 --> 01:09:52,194
That is not true.

1251
01:09:53,396 --> 01:09:55,765
Yeah, it is.

1252
01:09:57,935 --> 01:09:59,034
Okay, listen.

1253
01:09:59,036 --> 01:10:01,568
All right.

1254
01:10:01,570 --> 01:10:04,772
This could be my guy's last fight.

1255
01:10:04,774 --> 01:10:06,741
And I wanna make it count.

1256
01:10:06,743 --> 01:10:07,875
Now, on that note,

1257
01:10:07,877 --> 01:10:10,445
we would need you to
change your name to Creed.

1258
01:10:10,447 --> 01:10:12,783
It's just a formality.

1259
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:20,755
And what if I say no?

1260
01:10:20,757 --> 01:10:23,392
Well, then there's no fight.

1261
01:10:23,394 --> 01:10:24,759
Without the name, there's no fight.

1262
01:10:24,761 --> 01:10:28,062
It's a non-starter.

1263
01:10:28,064 --> 01:10:29,365
Okay. Okay.

1264
01:10:29,367 --> 01:10:33,067
Why don't you both take
a day, talk about it

1265
01:10:33,069 --> 01:10:36,738
and we'll, uh, see what you say, okay?

1266
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:39,008
It's a good deal.

1267
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:40,576
Can't do it.

1268
01:10:40,578 --> 01:10:43,512
Nah, it's not my name.

1269
01:10:43,514 --> 01:10:47,081
And plus, I wanna make
it on my own merit anyway.

1270
01:10:47,083 --> 01:10:48,483
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1271
01:10:48,485 --> 01:10:51,253
You got a funny way of showing it.

1272
01:10:51,255 --> 01:10:52,621
What's that supposed to mean?

1273
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:54,990
I mean, weren't Apollo and
Rocky like best friends?

1274
01:10:54,992 --> 01:10:58,626
It feels like you're trying to tap
into whatever it is he left behind.

1275
01:10:58,628 --> 01:11:01,929
I don't think that's anything
to be ashamed of, you know?

1276
01:11:01,931 --> 01:11:03,031
What are you afraid of?

1277
01:11:03,033 --> 01:11:05,968
Uh, what are you afraid of?

1278
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,035
I don't know.

1279
01:11:07,037 --> 01:11:09,437
I mean, this hearing shit don't scare you?

1280
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:11,439
Uh...

1281
01:11:11,441 --> 01:11:14,809
I always knew it would happen eventually

1282
01:11:14,811 --> 01:11:17,879
so my plan has always just been

1283
01:11:17,881 --> 01:11:21,849
to do what I love for as long as I can.

1284
01:11:21,851 --> 01:11:26,019
I think that's all we ever do. You know?

1285
01:11:26,021 --> 01:11:29,592
So, what are you afraid of?

1286
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:34,396
I'm afraid of taking

Yes.

He's taller than you.
He has a reach on you.

1308

Definitely has a lot
more experience than you.

He's the champion.

1311

And since he's the champion,

1312

you gotta bring the
fight to him, like I did.

wouldn't say nothing to nobody, okay?

Oh, come on, just put your gloves
on and stop talking so much.

be on your mind, nothing else.

this? When you starting treatment?

I am.

and put it into a bowl or something

<i>"Pretty" Ricky Conlan
in the black trunks,</i>

<i>and Adonis Creed in the
red, white and blue.</i>

1920
01:50:23,925 --> 01:50:26,826
<i>Conlan is significantly taller</i>

1921
01:50:26,828 --> 01:50:29,362
<i>and thinks it will be
easy to use his jab</i>

1922
01:50:29,364 --> 01:50:31,263
<i>to keep young Creed at bay.</i>

1923

KELLERMAN: <i>You can
see right away, Jim,</i>

1924
01:50:32,633 --> 01:50:34,901
<i>how much more relaxed Conlan
is. He's been there before.</i>

Move your head!

Keep your left up!

1927
01:50:37,739 --> 01:50:39,071
KELLERMAN: <i>That kind
of nervous energy</i>

1928
01:50:39,073 --> 01:50:40,705
<i>can wear you out as
the fight goes on.</i>

1929
01:50:40,707 --> 01:50:42,575
LAMPLEY: <i>Hard left hook by
Conlan. Creed backs off.</i>

1930

KELLERMAN: <i>It's not easy
to just jump right into</i>

1931

<i>the major leagues like this,</i>

1932
01:50:45,913 --> 01:50:47,680
<i>having never fought an
opponent like Conlan.</i>

1933
01:50:47,682 --> 01:50:50,049
<i>Of course, there aren't
many fighters like Conlan.</i>

<i>Creed trying to get close to
Conlan, against the ropes.</i>

1935
01:50:52,887 --> 01:50:56,054
<i>Conlan easily puts distance
between them again.</i>

1936
01:50:56,056 --> 01:50:58,456
<i>Creed lands a jab,
Conlan grins at it.</i>

1937
01:50:58,458 --> 01:51:00,125
<i>Conlan fires a hard body punch,</i>

1938
01:51:00,127 --> 01:51:01,693
<i>hits him hard with a right cross</i>

1939
01:51:01,695 --> 01:51:03,496
<i>and backs Creed into the ropes.</i>

warning from the referee.</i>

1943
01:51:07,969 --> 01:51:09,902
KELLERMAN: <i>Creed kinda
woke him up with that shot</i>

1944
01:51:09,904 --> 01:51:12,304

made him pay for it.</i>

All right, look. Don't get rattled.

I'm gonna knock his ass out.

1966

Do it in the next round. Don't wait.

1967

You keep making mistakes like that,

Come on, baby. What you doing?

1971

Here's what I want you to do.

1972
01:52:03,658 --> 01:52:05,790
He's gonna jab and throw the right.

1973
01:52:05,792 --> 01:52:08,728
When he leaves it out there, drop
that right hook and smash him, okay?

01:52:08,730 --> 01:52:10,396
Stay focused.

1975
01:52:10,398 --> 01:52:13,232
LAMPLEY: <i>So round one was a forbidding
experience for young Adonis Creed.</i>

01:52:13,234 --> 01:52:16,434
<i>And now, after a discussion with
Rocky Balboa between rounds,</i>

uppercut at the end of round one,</i>

Be first!

Keep the pressure on, Rick!

1982

LAMPLEY: <i>Logic says
Creed needs to find</i>

1983

<i>a way to get inside
of Conlan's long arms</i>

You the champ, right, huh?

You're not as far behind as you think.

Shorten that jab, shorten the distance,

get underneath him, and
you'll be able to rip him.
